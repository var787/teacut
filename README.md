Building a event ticketing application for local events

Alright, here are some basic user stories to give you an idea of the workflow based on a standard event management system like Eventbrite. I've divided them into three user roles: Event Organizers, Attendees, and Administrators. 

**Event Organizers:**
1. As an event organizer, I want to create an account so that I can start managing my events.
2. As an event organizer, I want to create an event by providing details like event name, location, date/time, seat map and ticket prices so that attendees can see the information.
3. As an event organizer, I want to manage ticket types (like early bird, VIP, general) and their availability so that I can control my event's capacity.
4. As an event organizer, I want to view real-time sales and attendee data so that I can gauge the success of my event.
5. As an event organizer, I want to receive notifications when tickets are purchased, so I can keep track of the sales.
6. As an event organizer, I want to be able to refund tickets if an attendee requests it or if the event is canceled.

**Attendees:**
1. As an attendee, I want to create an account so I can purchase tickets and keep track of my events.
2. As an attendee, I want to search for events by location, date, and category so I can find ones that interest me.
3. As an attendee, I want to purchase tickets through a secure payment system so I can safely attend events.
4. As an attendee, I want to receive a confirmation email when I purchase a ticket so I have proof of my purchase.
5. As an attendee, I want to view my purchased tickets so I can keep track of my upcoming events.
6. As an attendee, I want to request a refund if I can no longer attend an event or if it's cancelled.

**Administrators:**
1. As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts so I can control access to the platform.
2. As an administrator, I want to view all events and their details so I can monitor the platform's activities.
3. As an administrator, I want to be able to remove events or users that violate platform policies to maintain a safe and respectful community.
4. As an administrator, I want to view and analyze platform usage statistics (like number of users, number of events, most popular events) so I can improve the platform and marketing efforts.
